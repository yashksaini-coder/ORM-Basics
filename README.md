## ORM Basics

### Objectives

1. Understand what an ORM is and why it is useful
2. Understand how to use an ORM to interact with a database
3. Understand how to use an ORM to create, read, update, and delete records in a database
4. Understand how to use an ORM to create relationships between tables in a database
5. Understand how Primary and Foreign Keys are used in an ORM

Tech companies often have to deal with large amounts of data. This data is typically stored in a database. A database is a structured collection of data. Databases are used to store, manage, and retrieve data. Databases can be classified into two types: SQL and NoSQL. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in documents, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores.


### Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. ORM is a bridge between the object-oriented world and the relational world. ORM frameworks provide a mechanism for mapping object-oriented programming language objects to database tables. ORM frameworks allow developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented programming language, such as Python, instead of SQL.

ORM frameworks provide a higher-level abstraction over the database. ORM frameworks allow developers to interact with a database using objects instead of tables. ORM frameworks provide a way to define the structure of a database using classes and objects. ORM frameworks provide a way to query a database using methods and properties. ORM frameworks provide a way to manipulate data in a database using objects and methods.

### Prisma ORM

Prisma is an ORM framework for Node.js and TypeScript. Prisma provides a way to interact with a database using an object-oriented programming language, such as JavaScript or TypeScript. Prisma provides a way to define the structure of a database using classes and objects. Prisma provides a way to query a database using methods and properties. Prisma provides a way to manipulate data in a database using objects and methods.
